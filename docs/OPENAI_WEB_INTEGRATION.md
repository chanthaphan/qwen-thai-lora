4. **✅ Virtual Environment**: Confirmed OpenAI library is available in your `llm-env`

### 🚀 **How to Use OpenAI Models in Web Interface**

1. **Start the Web Interface**:
   ```bash
   ./manage.sh chat-web
   ```
   
2. **Select OpenAI Backend**:
   - In the web interface, you'll see a "Backend" dropdown
   - Select **"OpenAI"** from the dropdown
   
3. **Choose Your Model**:
   - The "Model" dropdown will automatically update to show OpenAI models:
     - `gpt-4o` (recommended)
     - `gpt-4o-mini` (faster, cheaper)
     - `gpt-5` (latest model) ⭐
     - `gpt-5-mini` (latest mini model) ⭐
     - `gpt-4` (previous generation)
     - `gpt-3.5-turbo` (budget option)

### 🔑 **API Key Requirement**

- **Without API Key**: You can see and select OpenAI models, but you'll get an error when trying to chat
- **With API Key**: Full functionality including GPT-5 models

To set your API key:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### 🌟 **Available Backends**

Your web interface now supports **three backends**:

1. **🏠 Ollama** - Local models (llama3.1:8b, qwen3:8b, etc.)
2. **🇹🇭 vLLM** - Your fine-tuned Thai model 
3. **☁️ OpenAI** - Cloud models including GPT-5 series

### 🎯 **GPT-5 Model Notes**
